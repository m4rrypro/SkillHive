# Learn SSH (Secure Shell)
SSH is a protocol used to securely log in to remote servers, transfer files, and execute commands.

## Key Concepts:
- **Authentication**: Password-based or key-based authentication.
- **File Transfers**: Using `scp` or `rsync` for secure file transfers.
- **Tunneling**: Port forwarding for accessing remote services.

## Practice Tasks:
1. Set up an SSH connection to a remote server.
2. Use `scp` to transfer a file between your computer and the server.
3. Create SSH keys and configure key-based authentication.
