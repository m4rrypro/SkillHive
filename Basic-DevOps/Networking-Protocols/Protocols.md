# Key Networking Protocols

## What Are Networking Protocols?
Networking protocols are standardized rules and procedures that govern how data is transmitted, received, and interpreted across computer networks. They define the format, timing, sequencing, and error control in data communication.

## Key Protocols:
- **TCP/IP**: The fundamental suite for Internet communication.
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Used for web browsing and secure data transfer on the web.
- **FTP/SFTP**: Protocols for transferring files between computers.
- **SMTP/POP3/IMAP**: Used for email communication.
- **DNS**: Resolves domain names to IP addresses.
- **DHCP**: Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network.
- **SSL/TLS**: Ensures secure, encrypted communication over the web.
- **UDP**: Enables fast, connectionless data transmission.

## Practice Tasks:
1. Explore your computer's network settings to identify how DHCP and DNS are used.
2. Use a packet analyzer (e.g., Wireshark) to observe TCP and UDP traffic.
3. Set up a simple HTTP server and test HTTPS using self-signed certificates.
