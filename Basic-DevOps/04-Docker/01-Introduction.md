# Docker

Docker is an open-source platform that simplifies the development, deployment, and management of applications using containerization technology. This README serves as a starting point for understanding Docker and its role in modern application workflows.

## Introduction

### What are Containers?

Containers are lightweight, portable, and isolated software environments that allow developers to run and package applications with their dependencies, consistently across different platforms. They help to streamline application development, deployment, and management processes while ensuring that applications run consistently, regardless of the underlying infrastructure.

### Need for Containers

Containers solve the issue around inconsistent environments when working in large teams. Before containers or virtual environments, a lot of issues and time loss was caused by having to install and configure local environments to build projects shared by co-workers or friends.

### Bare Metal vs VM vs Containers

1. **Bare Metal**:  
   Runs directly on hardware without virtualization. Provides high performance but limited flexibility (one application per server, no easy migration).  
2. **Virtual Machines (VMs)**:  
   Runs multiple operating systems on a single server using a hypervisor. Provides isolation and flexibility but adds resource overhead.  
3. **Containers**:  
   Runs multiple applications on a single server without a hypervisor. Provides better resource utilization and portability with minimal overhead.

### Docker and OCI

The Open Container Initiative (OCI) is a Linux Foundation project which aims at creating industry standards for container formats and runtimes. Its primary goal is to ensure the compatibility and interoperability of container environments through defined technical specifications.

**You can learn more from the following resources:**
- [Introduction to OCI](https://opencontainers.org/)
- [Docker and OCI Compliance](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/oci/)
